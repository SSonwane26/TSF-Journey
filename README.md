# TSF-Journey
Story of my journey in The Spark Foundation as Intern, complete information of my Projects and my Final Presentations.

Good Morning, I am Saurabh. Today, I'm here to provide detailed information about my journey as a intern at The Spark Foundation.

### About Me
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Saurabh Sonwane. I hold a degree in mechanical engineering and have been working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (GET) in a multinational corporation. During my tenure there, my curiosity was piqued by the world of data sciences and analytics. I embarked on a journey to learn various analysis techniques, utilizing tools such as MS Excel and PowerBI. Additionally, I honed my programming skills in SQL and Python.

### About The Spark Foundation
The Sparks Foundation, also known as The Sparks Foundation Singapore (TSF Singapore), is a non-profit organization based in Singapore dedicated to empowering students and building the next generation of leaders. Their mission is to inspire, innovate, and integrate students from all financial backgrounds, creating a more equal and just world.

Their flagship program, GRIP, provides students with hands-on experience in various fields like web development, content marketing, and finance. Interns receive mentorship, workshops, and a chance to work on real-world projects.

## About Projects
### Project One
EDA-Terrorism [Report](https://github.com/SSonwane26/TSF-Journey/blob/main/terrorism_analysis.pdf)

Definition of terrorism: "The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."

EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis, is a crucial phase in the data analysis process. It involves examining and visualizing data sets to understand their main characteristics, identify patterns, and uncover insights. EDA employs statistical graphics, summary statistics, and other analytical techniques to provide an overview of the data's structure and relationships. The primary goals of EDA are to discover patterns, detect anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying story within the data, which can guide further analysis and decision-making.

"I am currently involved in a project titled 'EDA Terrorism,' where my role is that of a security and defense analyst. In this project, my responsibility is to identify and analyze the hot zones of terrorism, employing exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights and inform strategic decisions."

**About Dataset:**

This comprehensive dataset contains information on over 180,000 terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017, including details such as date, location, target, perpetrator, and fatalities. The dataset comprises a table with the following key columns:
- Attack Date- Records the date of each incident.
- Attack Locations- Specifies the locations where the attacks occurred.
- Attack Rates- Provides information on the rates associated with the attacks.
- Attack Types- Classifies the types of attacks that took place.
- Target Types- Identifies the types of targets involved in the incidents.
- Weapon Types- Describes the weapons used in the attacks.
- Attacker Group Name- Indicates the name of the group responsible for the attack.
- Nationality- Specifies the nationality of the attackers.
- Number of Kills- Records the total number of casualties in each attack, distinguishing between civilians and attackers.
- Other Columns- Additional columns capturing relevant information about the incidents.

See the [GTD Codebook](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf) for important details on data collection methodology, definitions, and coding schema.

**Cleaninig and Preprocessing the Data:**

For this project, we will be utilizing Power BI, chosen for its user-friendly interface that facilitates effective storytelling. The process begins with a comprehensive understanding of the data, followed by meticulous data cleaning. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Understanding the Data:
   - Gain insights into the structure and content of the dataset.

1. Cleaning the Data:
   - Load the CSV file into Power Query for data transformation.
   - Remove unwanted rows and columns to streamline the dataset.
   - Adjust data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Rename columns for clarity and coherence.
   - Replace values, such as converting "success" values to binary (0 for "NO" and 1 for "YES").

**Creating Dashboard:**

In the process of developing our dashboard using Power BI, we've identified key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual elements to convey meaningful insights. Here's a clear and pointwise explanation:

KPIs:
- Maximum Attacks in a Year- Highlights the year with the highest number of attacks.
- Total Attacks- Presents an overview of the overall number of attacks in the dataset.
- Kills in Attacks- Provides a total count of casualties resulting from the attacks.
- Most Used Weapon- Identifies the weapon type that is most frequently employed.
- Most Deadly Group- Points out the attacker group associated with the highest casualty count.

Donut Charts:
- Weapon Type and Success- Illustrates the distribution of success outcomes based on weapon types.
- Attack Type and Success- Displays the relationship between attack types and their success rates.
- Target Type and Success- Shows how success varies based on different target types.

Line Chart: 
- Success Rate by Year- Visualizes the success rate trend over the years, providing insights into the effectiveness of countermeasures.

Bar Chart: 
- Region and Success- Depicts success rates in different regions, aiding in regional trend analysis.

Column Chart: 
- Attacker Group Name and Success- Presents success rates associated with different attacker groups.

Map: 
- City-wise Success Rate- Utilizes a geographical map to display success rates, allowing for a spatial understanding.

Slicer: 
- Region- Enables users to filter the dashboard based on regions, offering a more focused view of the data.

**Insights:**

The analysis of the dataset has yielded several insightful findings:
- Peak Year: Maximum attacks occurred in the year 2014.
- Overall Impact:
   - Across all years, there were a total of 175,230 attacks.
   - These attacks resulted in a total of 409,790 casualties.

- Weapon Insights: The most frequently used weapon type is explosives.
- Deadliest Group: The Taliban emerged as the most deadly group.
- Top Weapon Types: The top three weapon types are explosives, firearms, and incendiary.
- Top Attack Types: The predominant attack types are bombing/explosions, armed assault, and assassination.
- Top Target Types: Primary targets include private citizens and property, military, and police.
- Top Attack Groups: The leading attack groups are the Taliban, ISIL, and Shining Path.
- Geographical Hotspots: Most attacks occurred in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and South America.
- Global Trend: The trend analysis indicates a year-by-year increase in global attacks.

These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of the patterns and dynamics within the dataset, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic planning in the realm of security and defense.

**Suggestions:**

As a military and defense analyst, here are some straightforward suggestions based on the insights gathered:
1. Focus on Explosive Countermeasures:
   - Since explosives are the most commonly used weapons, prioritize the development and implementation of advanced countermeasures against explosive devices. This may include investing in technology for detection and disposal.
1. Target Taliban and High-Risk Groups:
   - Given that the Taliban is identified as the most deadly group, direct efforts toward countering their activities. Formulate targeted strategies and intelligence operations to disrupt their operations.
1. Protect Civilian and Key Infrastructure:
   - Prioritize the protection of private citizens and property, as well as critical infrastructure. Develop plans and strategies to safeguard civilians and key assets in the event of an attack.
1. Monitor and Combat Rising Groups:
   - Keep a close eye on emerging threat groups, especially those ranking just below the Taliban and ISIL. Early detection and proactive measures can prevent these groups from gaining prominence.
1. Continuous Global Threat Assessment:
   - Given the increasing trend in global attacks year by year, establish a system for continuous threat assessment. Regularly review and update security protocols based on evolving patterns and emerging threats.
1. Public-Private Partnerships for Security:
    - Foster partnerships between the public and private sectors to enhance overall security. Collaboration with businesses, communities, and individuals can create a more resilient and responsive security environment.
